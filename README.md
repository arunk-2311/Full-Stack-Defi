# Full-Stack-Defi
This is my practise code of blockchain tutorial by patrick collins in freecodecamp,the front end for the web3 website is still a work in progress.Rest has been completed.

# Modified features:
The whole application is made to run on rinkeby rather than on kovan.
After unstaking the user's account address is removed from the staker's list,this is something patrick left to the audience to try it themselves.
